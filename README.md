# ransac_tutorial

This is the tutorial for the RANSAC algorithm taught at the Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt, in the course of mobile robotics. 


## Search for the line model
Use the existing *[template](https://github.com/christianpfitzner/ransac_tutorial/blob/master/ransac_template.m) to write the RANSAC algorithm to find the line. 


## Search for the circle model
If you finished the first task, extend your approach, so the circle is found.
